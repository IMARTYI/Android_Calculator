This is a rundown of the Calculator Assingment.


1. implemented the memory feature.
	- Pressing S will save the current number on the text field and present it at the top of the screen.
	- Pressing R will make that number an operand and put that number as the current working value.

2. Implemented the Decimal Key.
	- Pressing "." wil make acomodate for floating point numbers.

3. Implemented the negative key
	- Pressing the Â± will make the current working opperand into a negative number.
	-  a-(-b) = -a +b



> Basic operations are implemented fully.
> when pressing the operator, the main view will clear waiting for the second operator.
> Code is fully commented.
> Pressing two operators in a row will simply replace the operator.
	3+* = 3*

> Pressing operator after pressing operand, operator, and operand will compute the result of the first expression.\

> Pressing operand and then equaul will simply return the number that is currently on the display.

> Pressing  "C" will clear both digits and an operators.

>Pressing "AC" will clear all operands and operators.

>Dvision by zero will display an error message.

>Landscape mode is fully operational and remebers the state of the program when rotated.
